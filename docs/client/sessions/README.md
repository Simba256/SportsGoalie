# Development Session Logs

This folder contains detailed logs of all development work on the SportsGoalie platform. These sessions provide a comprehensive view of what was built, when, and why.

## Purpose

- **Progress Tracking:** Document completed features and milestones
- **Feature Discovery:** Understand what the platform can do
- **Project Knowledge:** Provide context about recent work
- **Historical Record:** Maintain a complete development history

## What's Included

Each session log documents:
- ✅ Features and deliverables completed
- ✅ User benefits and impact

- ✅ Testing and verification
- ✅ Next steps and future enhancements

These sessions focus on **what was built** and **why it matters** rather than low-level technical implementation details.

## When Sessions Are Created

Sessions are created for:
- ✅ Significant features or enhancements
- ✅ Milestone or phase completions
- ✅ New functionality that changes user experience
- ✅ Major improvements with visible impact
- ✅ System integrations and major updates

## Session Organization

### File Naming
Sessions use the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-feature-name.md`

**Examples:**
- `2026-02-23-custom-curriculum-system-mvp.md`
- `2026-02-22-coach-invitation-system.md`
- `2026-02-24-ai-project-assistant.md`

### Chronological Order
Sessions are organized by date, making it easy to:
- See what was built recently
- Track project evolution over time
- Find specific features by date
- Understand development timeline

## Session Template

Each session follows a consistent structure:

### Required Sections
- **Date, Type:** When the work was done and what kind of work
- **Summary:** Quick 2-3 sentence overview
- **Goals:** What the session aimed to accomplish
- **Deliverables:** What was completed, in progress, or blocked
- **Key Features Added:** Detailed feature descriptions with locations
- **Impact & Benefits:** Why this matters to users

### Optional Sections
- **Changes Overview:** Categorized list of changes
- **Testing & Verification:** How it was validated
- **Technical Highlights:** High-level architecture notes
- **Known Issues:** Any limitations or pending work
- **Next Steps:** Future work related to this feature

## Writing Style

### Focus On
- **User Value:** What can users do now that they couldn't before?
- **Feature Benefits:** How does this improve the platform?
- **Clear Descriptions:** Explain features in understandable terms
- **Practical Examples:** Show how features are used
- **Specific Locations:** Include page routes and access points

### Avoid
- Low-level code implementation details
- Technical jargon without explanation
- Debugging logs or error traces
- Line-by-line code changes
- Internal development processes

## Example Sessions

See the recent sessions in this folder for examples:

- **[Custom Curriculum System MVP](./2026-02-23-custom-curriculum-system-mvp.md)** - Major feature launch with coach tools
- **[AI Project Assistant](./2026-02-24-ai-project-assistant.md)** - Intelligent chatbot implementation
- **[Coach Invitation System](./2026-02-22-coach-invitation-system.md)** - Email-based onboarding workflow
- **[Multi-Role Authentication](./2026-02-22-multi-role-authentication.md)** - Four-role system implementation

## Integration with Project Assistant

These session logs are accessible to the Project Assistant AI chatbot (available at `/admin/project-assistant`). The assistant can:
- Answer questions about recent work
- Explain what features were added
- Provide context about development progress
- Reference specific sessions for details

**Example Questions:**
- "What features were added recently?"
- "Tell me about the custom curriculum system"
- "What was completed this week?"
- "Show me the coach invitation workflow"

## Time Estimates

Time estimates in sessions reflect realistic human developer time including:
- Planning and design
- Implementation and coding
- Testing and debugging
- Documentation
- Code review and refinement
- Deployment and verification

These are actual time investments, not idealized estimates.

## Best Practices

### When Creating Sessions
1. **Write for your audience:** Clear, understandable language
2. **Focus on value:** Explain what users can do and why it matters
3. **Be specific:** Include routes, page names, and feature locations
4. **Show impact:** Quantify benefits when possible (faster, easier, better)
5. **Stay current:** Create sessions shortly after completing work
6. **Link concepts:** Reference related features or sessions

### Quality Standards
- Clear, concise writing
- Accurate time estimates
- Complete feature descriptions
- User-focused benefits
- Specific examples and locations
- No broken links or references
