# SmarterGoalie - Scope of Work

**Prepared for:** Michael
**Date:** 16th February 2026
**Version:** 1.0

---

## Project Overview

We're building **SmarterGoalie** - a digital training platform for ice hockey goalies based on your 6 Pillars methodology. The platform will allow students to learn through video lessons, take evaluations, track their progress, and receive coaching feedback.

---

## What We're Building

### The 6 Pillars System

Your training methodology organized into a digital learning path:

1. **Mind-Set Development** - Mental game, resilience, the Mind Vault
2. **Skating as a Skill** - Edgework, lateral movement, efficiency
3. **Form & Structure** - Stance, positioning, paddle control
4. **Positional Systems** - 7 Angle-Marker and 7 Point Systems
5. **7 Point System Below Icing Line** - Specialized below-line positioning
6. **Game/Practice/Off-Ice Performance** - Holistic training approach

Each pillar has **3 levels**: Introduction → Development → Refinement

Students must pass evaluations to unlock the next level.

## Timeline Summary

| Phase | What | Weeks | Cumulative |
|-------|------|-------|------------|
| Phase 2 | Core Platform | 5-6 | Week 6 |
| Phase 3 | Rich Content | 2-3 | Week 9 |
| Phase 4 | Dashboards | 2-3 | Week 12 |

## Canadian Privacy Compliance

Since the platform serves children ages 6+, we'll include:

- **Under 13:** Parent must create account first and give consent
- **13-17:** Age-appropriate registration with optional parent linking
- **All ages:** Privacy-first default settings
- **Parents:** Can view, download, or delete their child's data anytime
- **Data:** Only collect what's necessary, stored securely

This follows Canadian PIPEDA requirements.

---

## What's Already Built (Phase 1 - Complete)

The foundation is already in place:
- User login and registration
- Video quiz system (works well, we'll reuse it)
- Game and practice charting system
- Admin content management
- Basic analytics dashboards

This gives us a head start - we're building on a solid foundation, not starting from scratch.

---

## How We'll Work Together

### Communication
- Regular updates on progress
- Demo of features as they're completed
- Quick responses to questions and feedback

### Flexibility
- This timeline is a guideline, not a rigid contract
- We can adjust priorities based on what matters most
- Some features may be faster or slower depending on complexity discovered

### Your Input Needed
- Review features as they're built
- Provide content for lessons and evaluations
- Feedback on what's working and what needs adjustment
- Decisions on subscription tier features and pricing

---

## Decisions We've Confirmed

| Topic | Decision |
|-------|----------|
| Coach permissions | Can edit lessons AND leave comments/feedback per student |
| Parent access | Full visibility - all scores, tests, videos, coach comments |
| Evaluation review | Automatic - score determines level unlock (no manual review) |
| Payment timing | After core features, before social/multi-sport |

---

## What Success Looks Like

By the end of this project:

✅ Students can work through your 6 Pillars methodology at their own pace
✅ Coaches can monitor students and provide personalized feedback
✅ Parents stay informed about their child's progress
✅ You have full control over content and can update it anytime
✅ The platform handles hundreds to thousands of users reliably
✅ Payments are set up for sustainable business operation
✅ Mobile-friendly so students can learn anywhere

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review this document** - Let us know if anything needs adjustment
2. **Confirm priorities** - Which features matter most for initial launch?
3. **Begin Phase 2** - Start with the user roles and 6 Pillars structure
4. **Regular check-ins** - We'll keep you updated on progress

## Questions?

If anything is unclear or you have questions about the approach, features, or timeline, let's discuss. This document is meant to be a starting point for our collaboration, not a rigid specification.
