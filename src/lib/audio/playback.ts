/**
 * Starting Coach Mike's voice on an iPhone.
 *
 * iOS Safari does not let a page start sound by itself. An audio element can
 * only be started from inside a tap until the first time a tap has started it;
 * from then on the page may play it whenever it likes, from a timer included.
 * Desktop browsers and Android Chrome decide per page rather than per element,
 * and are far more forgiving.
 *
 * The freeze-point voice starts itself: the video reaches the timestamp, the
 * frame holds and Michael speaks. Nobody taps, so on an iPhone that play is
 * refused unless the element was unlocked beforehand.
 *
 * `primeElement` unlocks it. It plays a tenth of a second of silence on the
 * shared element from inside a tap the goalie is making anyway ("Start Quiz",
 * with the play button and the taps that end a freeze as fallbacks). Nothing is
 * heard, and later plays from a timer are allowed.
 *
 * It is tied to those quiz taps, never to the first tap anywhere on the site:
 * starting audio on an iPhone takes over the phone's sound and pauses any music
 * the goalie had on. Each of those taps starts the video with sound, so it does
 * that already.
 *
 * Nothing in here touches React, so the browser tests can load it on its own.
