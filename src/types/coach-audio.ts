 * Coach Audio — Michael's recorded voice lines.
 *
 * Naming note: this codebase already uses "voice" for the parent feedback
 * feature (`parent_voice_submissions`, /admin/voice-queue). That is unrelated
 * to audio. Everything to do with Coach Mike's recordings is "coach audio".
 *
 * Two halves, deliberately kept apart:
 *
 *   COACH_AUDIO_CATALOGUE — what *should* exist. A code constant, because the
 *   IDs and the script lines are settled and are not editable data. Michael
 *   fixed these in the 9 September copy pack.
 *
 *   CoachAudioClip (Firestore) — what *has been uploaded*. One document per
 *   catalogue ID, keyed by the ID itself.
 *
 * Keeping them separate is what lets the admin screen show a clip as MISSING
 * rather than simply not showing it. On 12 September Michael sent 51 of the 59
 * files; the eight pillar intros (V-A-19 to V-A-26) were not in the folder even
 * though his pack said only MindSet was outstanding. A catalogue that lives in
 * code makes that kind of gap visible instead of silent.

 *
 * Two deliberate divergences from the written copy pack, both his and both
 * correct:
 *
 *   V-B-18 drops the "[N] weeks running." opening — he cannot speak a number
 *   that changes, so the streak count has to be rendered as on-screen text
 *   beside the audio.
 *
 *   V-B-22 records only the banner line, not the sub-line. The sub-line was
 *   always meant to be read rather than heard.

It is the result of a systematic, disciplined approach to every aspect of the game. You are the last line of defense. You occupy the most demanding position in hockey, where a split-second decision determines the outcome of the game. That kind of pressure requires more than physical skill. It requires an unshakable mental framework.\n\nThis is your Mind-Vault.\n\nThink of your Mind-Vault not as a fleeting feeling of confidence, but as a carefully curated repository of your greatest mental assets. It is an impenetrable inner sanctuary where we store your proven strategies, your hard-won successes, and the clarity required to perform under intense pressure.\n\nIn the heat of competition, when distractions rise and mistakes happen, you don't need to hope for confidence. You need to access it. Your Mind-Vault allows you to:\n\nStore and retrieve. Bank your brilliant saves and successful game scenarios, so you can withdraw that confidence exactly when you need it most.\n\nFilter the noise. Develop the laser-like focus necessary to see only what matters: the puck and the play.\n\nTrain the subconscious, the quickest part of your brain. We teach it to play in the now, free of negative influence, controlling the noise with the mantras you develop as your own.\n\nMaster the reset. Transform a challenging goal or a mistake into data, allowing you to re-calibrate and return to peak performance in seconds.\n\nI have spent my career studying what separates the good from the truly great, and it always comes back to one truth: Greatness is built, not born. We don't leave your mental game to chance. We teach you to organize, access, and command your mind with the same precision you apply to your skating and save selection.\n\nWhether you are just starting your journey or refining your game at the highest levels, your Mind-Vault is where your consistency, resilience, and ultimate performance begin.\n\nYour first deposit starts today. The next time the noise shows up, catch it, name it, and write down what you did. That's how a Mind-Vault is built, one deposit at a time.\n\nLet's start building yours.",

Your edges, your Set-Crouch, what makes motion fluid, what puts you in Game Frequency, and how movement, energy and time connect, all measured in relationship to the net.\n\nOnce you understand the pieces, you can look at your own game and see clearly where you are and where you want to grow.

Welcome to the 6 Zone - 7 Point System, your proprietary positional system designed to govern positional excellence below the icing line.\n\nAbove the line, the 7 Angle-Marker System made you the guardian of the net. Below the line is a different world, behind you, beside you, down in the corners, and without a system it is where a goalie can panic and scramble. This system puts you in the driver's seat, making sound strategic and tactical decisions.\n\nEverything we teach is built on four core filters: Logic. Common sense. Math. And science. And nowhere is order more valuable than here, because this system takes the most dynamic ice on the rink and applies a higher level of understanding. There is nothing mysterious about a wraparound, a walkout, or a pass from the side of the net or from the corner, and no play down low is too fast to read. Everything is an actionable principle you can deeply understand, execute, and make your own, so you move with the play instead of chasing it.\n\nOur first major objective is Knowledge Acquisition. We focus on building your Technical Eye so you can read the ice below the line analytically rather than reacting in panic.\n\nWe take it apart methodically, and teach you how to own your posts, when to stay on your feet and when to go down. We map the ice below the icing line with 7 grid lines, numbered 1 through 7, identical from left and right, with points 3, 4 and 5 behind the net where strategy and tactical play rule, keeping the advantage in your house. The 6 zones are the addition that elevates the map. This is your grid for smart positional consistency in the most dynamic part of the rink.\n\nThe grid never lies, and the location of the puck and the player, you dominate. The best part is it becomes a part of you. Your reads sharpen, your decisions speed up, and the chaos becomes a calm, mapped sequence.\n\nOnce you understand the individual pieces, you will progress through our structured learning loop, moving from initial instruction to recognition awareness and full dynamic transfer. You will look at your own play below the icing line with perfect clarity, using our video analysis, evaluation and charting tools, and your Goalie Baseline Profile grows with you. You will see exactly where you stand today and where you are growing. That is the essence of Self-Evaluation.\n\nI have spent six decades on the ice studying this beautiful, complex position.

Six decades later, this system exists so no goalie has to do that again, and so no parent has to guess how to help.\n\nIn the game of hockey, your child has chosen the position with the most responsibility. Our mission is to build Intelligent Athletic Goaltenders: goalies who understand their own game, can evaluate it honestly, and grow it on purpose. Everything we teach is built on four filters. Logic. Common sense. Math. And science. Nothing mysterious.\n\nHere is how it works. Your goalie learns eight pillars, one piece at a time. They chart what actually happened. The chart points to the work that matters. They practise it, and they chart again. The chart is a mirror. A gap isn't a failure. It's a roadmap.\n\nYou don't need to know the position to help. The system is built to educate parents alongside their goalie, in plain language, so you can learn at your own pace and understand what your child is working on, and why.\n\nWhat you share with us is not shown to your goalie directly. The system takes it in, and returns it to them selectively, as the right support at the right time. So be open with us. Every piece helps.\n\nThe most valuable thing you can give is steady support. Be supportive and encouraging, and avoid the temptation to coach from the stands. Let us carry the technical side.\n\nThis work is about more than stopping pucks. It builds character, confidence, and the habit of honest self-evaluation, for the rink and beyond it.\n\nMy commitment to you is a sincere effort, every day, to raise the bar for your goalie and for everyone around them.

That new understanding lets them look at their own skating honestly and see where they are and where they need improvement to grow their game. It is designed to motivate, to inspire, to encourage without discouraging.

Because positioning is measurable, goalies can evaluate their performance objectively, identify growth opportunities, and build confidence.

Then they can look honestly at how they handle those game situations, recognizing their decision making process along with strategy and tactical play.

Through the use of video analysis, as the technical grows and the goalie sees what I see, their self-awareness is heightened and self-evaluation becomes a reality. First they understand what good form is, then they can look at their own honestly and see where attention is required. It's clear, it's visual, and it's built to motivate.
