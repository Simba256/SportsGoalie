- **Integration Tests**: Component interactions and API flows
- **Browser Tests**: Complete user workflows with Playwright

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
npm run test

# Browser tests (requires development server running)
npm run test:e2e

# All tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```
